## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cpp-code
   ```

2. **Install Conan:**
   Make sure you have Conan installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install conan
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies specified in `conanfile.txt`:
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Build the project:**
   Use CMake to configure and build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
